See if we can do weekly sentiment and then predict the next weeks movement as there is a lot of noise.

Things to do:

Build a simple ANN and print curves to prove overfitting to justify using things such as dropout

Generate a proper figure of results from model.

Make moving averages for weekly sentiment

Get users and keywords for scraping

Keywords - find most correlated assets and use these as references etc.
